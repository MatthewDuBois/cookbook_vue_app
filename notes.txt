template must have single div with class named same as the page in KEBOB CASE because it's following HTML convention (because it's a "class" in a "div")

router must import the view

App.vue has the <router-view/> that calls the individual view pages


$route and $router are two completely seperate things....

$route is describing the fake route to get to a page ./foo/bar/etc
    the route that got you to the page

    this.$route is vue magic

$router is a vue library that is mimicking going from page to page

.push in vue is like .redirect in rails
